<h1>Unit 7 | Assignment - Distinguishing Sentiments</h1>

<h3>Background</h3>

Twitter has become a wildly sprawling jungle of information &mdash
140 characters at a time. Somewhere between 350 million and 500 million tweets are estimated to be sent out _per day_. With such an explosion of data, on Twitter and elsewhere, it becomes more important than ever to tame it in some way, to concisely capture the essence of the data.

Choose <b>one</b> of the following two assignments, in which you will do just that. Good luck!

<h3>News Mood</h3>

In this assignment, you'll create a Python script to perform a sentiment analysis of the Twitter activity of various news oulets, and to present your findings visually.

Your final output should provide a visualized summary of the sentiments expressed in Tweets sent out by the following news organizations: <b>BBC, CBS, CNN, Fox, and New York Times</b>.

The tools of the trade you will need for your task as a data analyst include the following: <b>tweepy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, textblob, and VADER.</b><br><br>




```python
# Import dependencies
import tweepy
import json
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from vaderSentiment.vaderSentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
analyzer = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
import time
from config import api_key, api_secret, a_token, a_token_secret
```


```python
# Setup Tweepy API Authentication
auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(api_key, api_secret)
auth.set_access_token(a_token, a_token_secret)
api = tweepy.API(auth, parser=tweepy.parsers.JSONParser())
```


```python
#Get tweets from each news organization's twitter feeds.

# Create an empty list to hold sentiments.
sentiments = []


## I found that using CBSNews vs CBS drastically changed the output. 
## CBS tends to be more positive while CBSNews is more negative. 
## I left both pieces of code to show that either could be used, but opted to use both CBS and CBSNews to 
## illustrate the drastic difference in the two.

# news_outlet = ("@BBCNews", "@CBSNews", "@CNN", "@FoxNews", "@NYTimes")
news_outlet = ("@BBCNews", "@CBS", "@CNN", "@FoxNews", "@NYTimes", "@CBSNews")



# Loop though target users.
for user in news_outlet:
    
    # Counter 
    counter = 1

    # Loop through 5 pages of tweets for each news organization.
    # Get all tweets from the homefeed of each news organization.
    # Each page of tweets = 20, so by calling for a count of 100 
    # we accomplish the same thing with one less nested loop.

    public_tweets = api.user_timeline(user, count=100)

    #Loop through all tweets.
    for tweet in public_tweets:
    
        # Run the Vader analysis on each tweet.
        print("Tweet %s: %s" % (counter, tweet["text"]))

        # Establish the compound score, positive, negativem and neutral scores. 
        compound = analyzer.polarity_scores(tweet["text"])["compound"]
        pos = analyzer.polarity_scores(tweet["text"])["pos"]
        neu = analyzer.polarity_scores(tweet["text"])["neu"]
        neg = analyzer.polarity_scores(tweet["text"])["neg"]
        
        # define tweets ago and tweet_text
        tweets_ago = counter
        tweet_text = tweet["text"]

        # Append sentiments for each tweet to the empty sentiments list.
        sentiments.append({"News Outlet" : user,
                           "Date": tweet["created_at"],
                           "Compound" : compound,
                           "Positive" : pos,
                           "Negative" : neg,
                           "Neutral" : neu,
                           "Tweet Count" : counter,
                           "Tweet Text" : tweet_text})
        
        # Add to counter.
        counter = counter + 1

<h3>Chart 2: Bar Graph</h3>
The second plot will be a bar plot visualizing the <b>overall</b> sentiments of the last 100 tweets from each organization. For this plot, you will again aggregate the compound sentiments analyzed by VADER.


```python
# Set Seaborn style
sns.set()
orgPalette = sns.color_palette("Set2", len(news_outlet))
sns.set_palette(orgPalette)
sns.set_style("whitegrid")

# Set figure size
plt.figure(figsize = (10,8))

# Create bar graph
plt.bar(x_axis,scoresbyoutlet, label = news_outlet, color = orgPalette, edgecolor = "black")

for i, v in enumerate(scoresbyoutlet):
    plt.text(i-.3, v+.03, str(v).format(), color='black', fontweight='bold')

# Creates chart title
plt.title("Overall Media Sentiment Based on Twitter (%s)" % (time.strftime("%m/%d/%Y")),fontweight='bold')

# Establish ylim and labels 
plt.ylim(-.2, .45)
plt.ylabel("Tweet Polarity",fontweight='bold')
x_labels = ["BBC", "CBS", "CNN", "FOX", "NYT", "CBSNews"]

# Creates tickers
x_locations = [value for value in np.arange(6)]#tick locations
plt.xticks(x_locations, x_labels)

# Adds a horizontal line at zero
plt.axhline(y=0, color = 'black') 

#Show the Scatter Plot
plt.show()

# Save the Scatter Plot
plt.savefig('Overall Media Sentiment Based on Twitter.png')
```

<h3>Your final Jupyter notebook must:</h3>

* Pull last 100 tweets from each outlet.
* Perform a sentiment analysis with the compound, positive, neutral, and negative scoring for each tweet.
* Pull into a DataFrame the tweet's source acount, its text, its date, and its compound, positive, neutral, and negative sentiment scores.
* Export the data in the DataFrame into a CSV file.
* Save PNG images for each plot.

<h3>As final considerations:</h3>

* Use the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries.
* Include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.
* Include proper labeling of your plots, including plot titles (with date of analysis) and axes labels.
* Include an exported markdown version of your Notebook called  `README.md` in your GitHub repository.

<h1>Observations:</h1>
* In examining the scatter plot, it seems that all five of the news stations produce neutral tweets; however, it appears the CBSNews, NYTimes, and FoxNews have the most neutral tweets. It should be noted that this is not conclusive based on the scatter plot alone.
* Based on the bar chart, CBS is far more positive than any of the other news stations, especially compared to CBSNews, which trends more negative.
* Based on the last pull of tweets, NYTimes is the most negative in sentiment followed by CNN. This seems rather shocking when compared to the other outlets. 

<h3>Other considerations: </h3>
While both the scatter plot and bar chart illustrate the sentiment of each news outlets last 100 tweets, it does not give a conclusive or holisitc image of the news outlets' tweets. A more longitudinal analysis would need to be done for more conclusive insight. 

Additionally, while the assumption is that each of these outlets is producing <i>news</i>, the project never defined what news is. For example, news includes politics, NCAA basketball, technology, and many other topics. A news station who reports more on politics could result in skewed data (assumption is skewed negatively) compared to a news outlet that has spent a significant number of tweets discussing NCAA basketball champions.  

These factors may or may not impact the data shown, but is worth noting.
